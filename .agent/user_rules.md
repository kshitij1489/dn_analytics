# User Preferences & Rules

- **No Unauthorized Code Changes**: Always ask for explicit approval before making any code changes or file modifications. Providing explanations or answering questions does not count as approval for implementation.
- **Plan First**: Present an implementation plan and wait for the user to say "Approve" or "Proceed" before executing any edits.
